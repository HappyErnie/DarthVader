# LightSaber
This project is created using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. In this simple yet cool project, user can activate the lightsaber by clicking on the ON button. The activation of the lightsaber comes with lengthening/shortening and pulsating animation effects and sound. 

There are a total of 3 Star Wars characters (i.e. Darth Vader, Yoda & Luke Skywalker) created for this project and the images are stored in the Resources folder. The configuration required for each character is documented in the Lightsaber.css file.
